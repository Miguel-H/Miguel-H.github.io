	<h2>About me</h2>
	<div class="about"><p> Hello,my name is Miguel Hernandez. I am a student at Canoga Park High School, and this is my second 
	year in the Northrup Grumman HIP Prgram.My goal after High School is to pursue a career in electrical engineering or software
	design. The reasons why I have chosen to pursue a career in engineering is because I enjoy challenging my mind and solving problems.
	However, a career in science or mathematics wasn't the first option strirring in my head. Before, I wanted to work in animation
	and contribute to our next generations of animated shows and films. But when that creative quality of mine was utilized in the design 
	and programming of robotics, I skewed towards a career in engineering.The process of designing and programming a robot using the Lego Mindstorm
	kits,and having it complete challenges, caught my interest and enjoyment. I joined the HIP program so I can operate in and get an impression of 
	the engineering experience.
