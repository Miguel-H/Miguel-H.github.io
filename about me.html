	<h2>About me</h2>
	<div class="about"><p> Hello, my name is Miguel Hernandez. I am a student at Canoga Park High School, and a second year 
	mentee in the Northrup Grumman HIP Program. My goal after High School is to pursue a career in electrical or computer engineering. 
	The reason I have chosen to pursue a career in the field of engineering is because I enjoy challenging my mind and solving problems.
	However, a career in science or mathematics wasn't the first option strirring in my head. Originally, I wanted to work in animation
	and contribute to our next generations of animated shows and films. But when utilized my creativity in designing and programming robots, 
	I skewed towards a career in engineering. The experience of working with the LEGO Mindstorms robotics kits to design robots that complete 
	certain challenges caught my interest, so I looked into other programs that would offer the same experience. I joined the HIP program so I
	can work in and get an impression of the engineering experience. My expectations after I have finished the program is that I would have gained
	some of the skills and preparation I will need in pursuing my career.
